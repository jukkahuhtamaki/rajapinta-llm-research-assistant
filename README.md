* Advanced Data Analysis is now an integrated part of [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plus) 


Demo:
* [Session for generating a dataset](https://chat.openai.com/share/de26bf5b-0984-4d96-a388-20ddf93681d3)
* The generated dataset ("never" share data on Github)
* [Session for analyzing the dataset](https://chat.openai.com/share/793c6c92-7aa2-4c22-87fd-dd6cca0543fb) (live demo)

The first few prompts. Nothing fancy, just showing that one can indeed start with a very open-ended approach. 

    Hey, I am getting ready to give a demo on how to use Advanced Data Analysis as a research tool. The first thing would be to create a prompt for a Chat-GPT-based research assistant. How should I go about prompting?



    This is academic research, specifically. Let's consider CSCW as a potential outlet. The data set will be a synthetic sample of Reddit. We'll be initially focusing on the users of the platform. Specifically, identifying different types of users. Please recommend a prompt following the guidelines above.

Concluding remarks

* Sharing the data with ChatGPT is a showstopper in many cases 
* Creating a synthetic dataset enables using ChatGPT as a lead developer
* ... in which case you can run the code in your own environment
* Integrating code snippets definitely insists on development experience
* ... not to mention the need to evaluate and validate the approach that ChatGPT offers
* Bonus: try copying the description of your favorite analysis and using that as prompt
